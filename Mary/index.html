			<h2>The<br>Journey</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="poem-one">
			<p>One day you finally knew<br>
			what you had to do, and began,<br>
			though the voices around you<br>
			kept shouting<br>
			their bad advice--<br>
			though the whole house<br>
			began to tremble<br>
			and you felt the old tug<br>
			at your ankles.<br>
			"Mend my life!"<br>
			each voice cried.<br>
			But you didn't stop.<br>
			You knew what you had to do,<br>
			though the wind pried<br>
			with its stiff fingers<br>
			at the very foundations,<br>
			though their melancholy<br>
			was terrible.<br>
			It was already late<br>
			enough, and a wild night,<br>
			and the road full of fallen<br>
			branches and stones.<br>
			But little by little,<br>
			as you left their voices behind,<br>
			the stars began to burn<br>
			through the sheets of clouds,<br>
			and there was a new voice<br>
			which you slowly<br>
			recognized as your own,<br>
			that kept you company<br>
			as you strode deeper and deeper<br>
			into the world,<br>
			determined to do<br>
			the only thing you could do--<br>
			determined to save<br>
			the only life you could save.</p>

			<h2>Wild Geese</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="poem-two">
			<p>You do not have to be good.<br>
			You do not have to walk on your knees<br>
			for a hundred miles through the desert repenting.<br>
			You only have to let the soft animal of your body<br>
			love what it loves.<br>
			Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.<br>
			Meanwhile the world goes on.<br>
			Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain<br>
			are moving across the landscapes, <br>
			over the prairies and the deep trees,<br>
			the mountains and the rivers.<br>
			Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,<br>
			are heading home again.<br>
			Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,<br>
			the world offers itself to your imagination,<br>
			calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting<br>
			over and over announcing your place <br>
			in the family of things.</p>

			<h2>Song of the Builders</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="poem-three">
			<p>On a summer morning<br>
			I sat down<br>
			on a hillside<br>
			to think about God -</p>
			<p>a worthy pastime.<br>
			Near me, I saw<br>
			a single cricket;<br>
			it was moving the grains of the hillside</p>
			<p>this way and that way.<br>
			How great was its energy,<br>
			how humble its effort.<br>
			Let us hope</p>
			<p>it will always be like this,<br>
			each of us going on<br>
			in our inexplicable ways<br>
			building the universe.</p>

			<h3>1.</h3>
			<p>Understand, I am always trying to figure out<br>
			what the soul is,<br>
			and where hidden,<br>
			and what shape <br>
			and so, last week,<br>
			when I found on the beach<br>
			the ear bone<br>
			of a pilot whale that may have died<br>
			hundreds of years ago, I thought<br>
			maybe I was close<br>
			to discovering something <br>
			for the ear bone</p>
		</div>
		<div class="four-two">
			<h3>2.</h3>
			<p>
			is the portion that lasts longest<br>
			in any of us, man or whale; shaped<br>
			like a squat spoon<br>
			with a pink scoop where<br>
			once, in the lively swimmer's head,<br>
			it joined its two sisters<br>
			in the house of hearing,<br>
			it was only<br>
			two inches long<br> 
			and thought: the soul<br>
			might be like this <br>
			so hard, so necessary </p>

			<h2>Bone</h2>

			<h3>3.</h3>
			<p>yet almost nothing.<br>
			Beside me<br>
			the gray sea<br>
			was opening and shutting its wave-doors,
			unfolding over and over<br>
			its time-ridiculing roar;<br>
			I looked but I couldn't see anything<br>
			through its dark-knit glare;<br>
			yet don't we all know, the golden sand<br>
			is there at the bottom,<br>
			though our eyes have never seen it,<br>
			nor can our hands ever catch it</p>
		</div>
		<div class="four-four">
			<h3>4.</h3>
			<p>lest we would sift it down<br>
			into fractions, and facts<br>
			certainties<br>
			and what the soul is, also<br>
			I believe I will never quite know.<br>
			Though I play at the edges of knowing,<br>
			truly I know<br>
			our part is not knowing,<br>
			but looking, and touching, and loving,<br>
			which is the way I walked on,<br>
			softly,<br>
			through the pale-pink morning light.</p>
